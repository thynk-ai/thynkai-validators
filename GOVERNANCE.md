# Governance (thynkai-validators)

This repository affects how model contributions are evaluated.

## When a proposal is required

Open a proposal (issue) before changes that affect:
- scoring behavior (aggregate computation, weighting rules)
- normalization rules for validator output
- validator onboarding contract requirements
- fixture formats used across tools

## Decision rule

Maintainers evaluate:
- correctness and robustness under adversarial inputs
- backwards compatibility and migration burden
- transparency/explainability of reports
- security considerations
